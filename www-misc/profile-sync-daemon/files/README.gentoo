profile-sync-daemon and psd (it's a symbolic link) commands need
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR variable, but openrc is not set the variable.

Becase of this, openrc user has to specify the RUNTIME_DIR variable in
/etc/conf.d/psd.

And if you want to use profile-sync-daemon command directly, you must
set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR variable with same value of config's
RUNTIME_DIR. For this situation, there is a simple wrapper command
named epsd. This command reads the variable from /etc/conf.d/psd file.

And also, profile-sync-daemon needs resync call periodically. But
openrc has no timer event systems. My simple solution is calling by
cron. So, you can change the interval by editing /etc/cron.d/psd file.
This interval shares all psd users. If you want to set the value to
each users, you can edit the user's crontab by crontab -e.

Example
   */4 * * * * /usr/bin/epsd resync


* for overlayfs users
The users using overlayfs need to have sudo right to /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper.
This package installs /etc/sudoers.d/psd file with below contents

--- BEGIN ---
%users ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper
--- END ---

psd users must belong users group or modify the file's first entry.
